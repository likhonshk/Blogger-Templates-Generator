# Backend Functionality Blueprint

This document outlines the proposed backend architecture and key functionalities for the AI-Powered Blogger Template Generator.

## Core Components

### 1. AI Integration Layer
*   **Primary AI Provider**: Google Gemini API for intelligent parsing, analysis, and generation.
*   **Optional AI Fallback**: Integration with OpenAI API and Hugging Face Transformers to ensure robustness and flexibility in AI model access.
    *   Mechanism for dynamic switching between AI providers based on availability or performance.

### 2. Template Processing Engine
*   **XML/HTML Parsing**: Libraries for efficient parsing and manipulation of Blogger's XML and HTML template structures.
    *   Ability to interpret existing template layouts, styling, and widget definitions.
*   **Template Generation Module**: Responsible for constructing valid Blogger XML templates based on AI output.
    *   Ensuring compatibility with Blogger's platform standards.
    *   Generation of modular components (widgets, sections, styles).

### 3. API & Business Logic Layer
*   **Programming Language**: Python (proposed)
*   **Web Framework (for potential UI)**: Flask/Django/FastAPI (proposed) for handling API requests, orchestrating AI calls, and managing template generation workflows.
*   **Request Handling**:
    *   Receiving user requirements (design prompts, existing templates).
    *   Forwarding requests to the AI Integration Layer.
    *   Processing AI-generated output into structured template components.
    *   Returning generated Blogger XML templates.

## Key Backend Workflows

### 1. Design Specification to Template Generation
1.  User provides design requirements or specifications.
2.  API Layer sends requirements to AI Integration Layer.
3.  AI analyzes requirements and generates design principles/template structure.
4.  Template Processing Engine uses AI output to construct Blogger XML.
5.  Error Checking & Validation ensures template adherence to standards.
6.  Generated template is returned to the user.

### 2. Existing Template Analysis
1.  User uploads an existing Blogger template.
2.  Template Processing Engine parses the template.
3.  Parsed structure is sent to AI Integration Layer for analysis (e.g., understanding layout, features).
4.  AI provides insights or suggestions based on analysis.
5.  Insights are returned to the user.
