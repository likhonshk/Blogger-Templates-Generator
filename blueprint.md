# Backend Blueprint for AI-Powered Blogger Template Generator

This document outlines the proposed backend architecture and core functionalities for the AI-Powered Blogger Template Generator. The backend will serve as the intelligence hub, orchestrating AI model interactions, parsing capabilities, and the generation of Blogger XML templates.

## 1. Project Overview (Backend Focus)

The backend is responsible for:
*   Receiving user requests (e.g., design prompts, existing template uploads).
*   Interfacing with AI models (Gemini, OpenAI/Hugging Face).
*   Analyzing input to understand design requirements or existing template structures.
*   Generating valid and high-quality Blogger XML templates.
*   Ensuring error checking and validation of generated output.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 API Gateway/Web Framework
*   **Purpose**: Handle incoming HTTP requests, route them to appropriate services, and manage responses.
*   **Proposed Technology**: Flask, Django, or FastAPI (as mentioned in `README.md`). FastAPI is a strong candidate due to its performance and automatic API documentation.

### 2.2 AI Integration Service
*   **Purpose**: Abstract the interaction with various AI providers.
*   **Details**:
    *   **Primary AI**: Google Gemini API.
    *   **Fallback AI (Optional)**: OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers.
    *   **Functionality**:
        *   `analyze_design_specifications(prompt: str)`: Interprets user prompts for design principles.
        *   `parse_existing_template(xml_content: str)`: Analyzes an existing Blogger XML template to understand its structure, widgets, and styles.
        *   `generate_template_components(analysis_result: dict, user_preferences: dict)`: Generates individual Blogger widgets, sections, or styles based on AI analysis and user guidance.
        *   `generate_full_template(components: list)`: Assembles generated components into a complete Blogger XML template.

### 2.3 Template Processing & Generation Engine
*   **Purpose**: Manages the logic for constructing and validating Blogger XML templates.
*   **Proposed Technology**: Python's built-in XML parsing libraries (e.g., `xml.etree.ElementTree`) combined with custom logic.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   **XML Structure Management**: Programmatically build and manipulate XML trees conforming to Blogger's schema.
    *   **Component Assembly**: Combine various AI-generated components (widgets, sections) into a cohesive template.
    *   **Error Checking & Validation**: Implement checks against Blogger's known standards and common pitfalls to ensure generated templates are functional and valid.

### 2.4 Data Storage (Ephemeral/Local for initial versions)
*   **Purpose**: Temporarily store session-specific data or user preferences.
*   **Details**: For an initial version, complex database integration might not be necessary. In-memory storage or file-based caching could suffice. Future enhancements might involve a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) or cloud-based solutions.

## 3. Technology Stack (Backend Specific)

*   **Programming Language**: Python
*   **Web Framework**: FastAPI (recommended for its speed, modern features, and async support)
*   **Core AI**: Google Gemini API client library
*   **AI Fallback (Optional)**: OpenAI Python client, Hugging Face `transformers` library
*   **XML Processing**: `xml.etree.ElementTree` or `lxml`
*   **Dependency Management**: `pipenv` or `poetry`

## 4. Data Flow (High-Level Example: Generate from Prompt)

1.  **User Input**: User provides a design prompt (e.g., "Create a clean, minimalist blog template with a dark theme and two-column layout") via the frontend.
2.  **API Request**: Frontend sends a POST request to a backend endpoint (e.g., `/generate/from_prompt`).
3.  **API Gateway**: Receives the request and routes it to the AI Integration Service.
4.  **AI Integration Service**:
    *   Calls `analyze_design_specifications` with the user's prompt.
    *   Receives an AI-generated analysis of the design requirements.
    *   Calls `generate_template_components` to get individual Blogger XML parts.
    *   Calls `generate_full_template` to assemble these parts into a complete XML string.
5.  **Template Processing Engine**: Performs final validation and error checking on the generated XML.
6.  **Response**: The generated Blogger XML template is returned to the frontend.

## 5. Proposed Backend API Endpoints

*   `POST /generate/from_prompt`
    *   **Request Body**: `{ "prompt": "string", "preferences": {} }`
    *   **Response**: `{ "template_xml": "string", "errors": [] }`
    *   **Description**: Generates a Blogger template based on a textual design prompt.

*   `POST /generate/from_xml`
    *   **Request Body**: `{ "existing_xml": "string", "modifications": {} }`
    *   **Response**: `{ "template_xml": "string", "errors": [] }`
    *   **Description**: Analyzes an existing template and applies modifications or enhancements.

*   `GET /health`
    *   **Response**: `{ "status": "ok" }`
    *   **Description**: Basic health check for the backend service.

This blueprint provides a foundational understanding of the backend's design and functionality, guiding subsequent development efforts.
