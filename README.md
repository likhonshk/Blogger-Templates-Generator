# AI-Powered Blogger Template Generator

This project aims to develop an intelligent system that can parse, analyze, and generate fully compatible Blogger themes using advanced AI capabilities. Leveraging the Gemini API, with optional multi-provider fallback (OpenAI/Hugging Face), this tool will revolutionize the creation of Blogger templates.

## Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Blogger Template Generator** is designed to simplify and accelerate the process of creating custom Blogger themes. By utilizing cutting-edge AI models, the generator will understand design requirements, interpret existing template structures, and produce high-quality, functional Blogger XML templates.

## Features
*   **Intelligent Parsing**: Analyze existing Blogger templates or design specifications to understand layout, styling, and functionality.
*   **AI-Driven Analysis**: Leverage Gemini API (and optionally OpenAI/Hugging Face) to interpret user requirements and design principles.
*   **Automated Template Generation**: Create complete Blogger XML templates based on the analysis, ensuring compatibility and best practices.
*   **Modular Component Generation**: Generate individual Blogger widgets, sections, and styles.
*   **Customization Options**: Allow users to guide the AI with specific aesthetic or functional preferences.
*   **Error Checking & Validation**: Ensure generated templates adhere to Blogger's standards and are free of common errors.

## Technology Stack
*   **Core AI**: Google Gemini API
*   **AI Fallback (Optional)**: OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers
*   **Programming Language**: Python (proposed)
*   **Web Framework (for potential UI)**: Flask/Django/FastAPI (proposed)
*   **Template Processing**: XML/HTML parsing libraries
